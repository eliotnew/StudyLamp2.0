# StudyLamp2.0
This project, is the second iteration of the StudyLamp created during the third sprint of my devlopment of a single page web applicaiton
for Comp1004 for the UoP.

In order for it to work, The user must be using SMB109's local network.

Using Visual Studio 2019 The study Lamp was created to be a Single Page Web Application to operate phillips hue smart bulbs to guide
